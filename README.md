This repository contains various C++ programs, including recursion and dynamic programming (memorisation and tabulation).

1. Fibonacci.cpp

This program can calculate any Fibonacci numbers up to the 92nd number (93rd if you consider zero the first number in the Fibonacci sequence). There are three algorithms for the same task: recursion by brute force, recursion with memorisation, and tabulation.

Software requirements: C++ version 9.3.0, g++ version 9.3.0, and Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS.

Modules: Standard Input/Output Streams Library.

To get started, please open the Terminal application, switch to the directory containing the source code, and enter the following to compile and run the program:

g++ Fibonacci.cpp -o Fibonacci

./Fibonacci
